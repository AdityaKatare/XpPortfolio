Create a personal portfolio website using React that replicates the look and feel of the Windows XP desktop environment. The website should include the following features and structure:

🎯 Objective:
Build a fun, nostalgic portfolio website that mimics Windows XP — including boot-up, start menu navigation, draggable windows, and a taskbar showing active pages.

🧩 Features to Implement:

1. **Bootup Screen with Sound:**
   - On initial load, show a Windows XP boot screen (fake loading).
   - Play the classic Windows XP startup sound (startup.wav file in public folder).
   - Delay for 3–5 seconds before loading the main desktop UI.

2. **Desktop Interface:**
   - Main screen should look like the Windows XP desktop.
   - Show wallpaper, taskbar (bottom), and desktop icons if needed.

3. **Start Menu Navigation:**
   - A Start button on the taskbar opens a menu with:
     - 🖥️ Landing Page
     - 👤 About Me
     - 💼 Projects
     - ✉️ Contact
   - Clicking each menu item opens a new draggable window styled like Windows XP UI.

4. **XP-style Windows:**
   - Each section (Landing, About, etc.) opens in its own window.
   - Windows are draggable, minimizable, closable.
   - Add icons, borders, and styling similar to Windows XP windows.

5. **Taskbar State Handling:**
   - Every open window should appear in the taskbar as a button/tab.
   - Clicking the taskbar item should focus/minimize/restore the window.

6. **State Management:**
   - Use Zustand or React Context to manage open/closed window states.
   - No need for React Router.

7. **Firebase Studio (optional):**
   - Setup a contact form that sends data to Firestore.
   - Log page visits using Firebase Analytics or a Firestore collection.

8. **Styling:**
   - Use TailwindCSS (or CSS modules) with XP theme: classic blue, gray window borders, retro fonts.
   - Add hover effects and classic XP icons from free icon libraries.

9. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - Set up `gh-pages` package for one-click deployment.
   - Add `homepage` in package.json for correct pathing.

This website should serve as a creative and interactive portfolio that opens with nostalgia and engages visitors through a retro UI. Code it using React and deploy it using GitHub Pages. Scaffold the initial app layout and dummy components first.
